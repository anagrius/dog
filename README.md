# Dog, a documenter's best friend!

## Work in Progress

This project is not jet functional.

## Vision

Dog is a tool for writing documentation for larger IT projects using a
simple Markdown dialect.

It can either generate HTML pages or load `.dog` files an parse them directly
in your browser, you can even print them to PDF so even "suits" can use them.

Dog is customizable using CSS and will allow you to make the the resulting
HTML fit into your projects design or company website.

â€“ dog, dog, moose!
